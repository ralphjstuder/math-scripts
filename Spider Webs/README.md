## Spider Webs

A Graph Theory exploration of network transformations, following the fundamental logic of single node moves called "spiders paths". If "spider paths" are available, edges are created (branching off the current node) within the "spider web" object. Each node in the "spider web" represents a unique, homomorphic state of all nodes within the original graph.
