## Exponential Object 

A Graph Theory exploration, made for establishing large datasets on exponential graphs of common graph types. Exploring properties of the resulting subgraphs of connected homomorphisms, allows for a deeper understanding of nodes, connections and symmetries present within exponentially large graph sturctures. The data collected contains th number of homomorphisms and connected components along with the number and populations of isomorphic classes within the components. There is also a function for displaying only the spider moves from the exponential object. The seperate Spider Web file is an attempt to build this object up from scratch rather than isolate it within a much larger object. The Spider Web file contains an explanation of spider moves and webs.

*Needs more computing power than free version of Cocalc provides. Requires SageMath installation to run through Jupyter Notebook.
