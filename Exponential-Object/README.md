### Exponential Object 

A Graph Theory exploration, made for establishing large datasets on exponential graphs of common graph types. Through this, one can explore properties of the resulting subgraphs, allowing for a deeper understanding of nodes, connections and symmetries present within exponentially large graphical sturctures. The data collected contains number of homomorphisms and connected components along with the number and populations of isomorphic classes within the components.
