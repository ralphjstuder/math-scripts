### Principle of Inclusion Exclusion

A combinatorial concept used for counting and probabilities problems. Specifically, figuring out the number of ways to distribute objects such that no node receives more than x objects.

### Exponential Object 

A Graph Theory exploration, that integrates Group theory in analyzing symmetries and properties that are present within graph transformations. A spider web is a graph representing network transformations, following the fundamental logic of single node moves called "spiders paths". If a "spider path" is available, edges are created (branching off the current node) within the "spider web" object. Each node in the "spider web" represents a unique, homomorphic state of all nodes of one graph mapped onto another graph. A graph's Pleat is the stiff form of a graph, meaning no spider moves can be made and thus the graph is in its most reduced form. The factor group function finds the factor group or the quotient of the automorphism group over the automorphism group that is spiderable to the identity. The research paper associated with this code proves multiple things about the automorphism group of graph transformations including that the factor group mentioned above is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of a graph's Pleat. The injective homomorphism returns an injective mapping of the original graph's vertices onto its Pleat.
