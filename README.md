### Principle of Inclusion Exclusion

A combinatorial concept used for counting and probabilities problems. Specifically, figuring out the number of ways to distribute objects such that no node receives more than x objects.

### Exponential Object 

A Graph Theory exploration, made for establishing a large dataset on exponential graphs, combining common graph types. Through this, one can explore properties of the resulting subgraphs, allowing for a deeper understanding of nodes, connections and symmetries present within exponentially large graphical sturctures. The data collected contains number of homomorphisms and connected components along with the number and populations of isomorphic classes within the components.

### Spider Webs

A Graph Theory exploration of network transformations, following the fundamental logic of single node moves called "spiders paths". If "spider paths" are available, edges are created (branching off the current node) within the "spider web" object. Each node in the "spider web" represents a unique, homomorphic state of all nodes of one graph mapped onto another graph.
