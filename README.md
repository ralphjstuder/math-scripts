The Principle of Inclusion Exclusion, a combinatorial concept, is used for different counting and probabilities problems. Specifically, figuring out the number of ways to distribute objects such that no node receives more than x objects.

Exponential object is a a Graph Theory exploration, made for establishing a large dataset on exponential graphs, combining common graph types. Through this, one can explore properties of the resulting subgraphs, allowing for a deeper understanding of nodes, connections and symmetries present within exponentially large graphical sturctures.
